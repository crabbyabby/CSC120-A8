Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I decided to overload the constructors because I think it can be unrealistic to have all the information when creating a new class.
For example, you may want to make a house but don't know the name yet, or if it has an elevator. So, I overloaded all of the constructors.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think you should read the readme carefully and give yourself a lot of tiem before doing this.
